# AI-Based-Text-Analyzer

This is the project I worked on during my internship at HCL Technologies from July 15 to August 31, 2022 under the guidance of Mr. Zeelan Shaik, Senior Solution Architext and Associate General Manager at HCL Technologies, Bangalore.

It is a natural language processing system which accepts any kind of text and analyzes it to discover and share details related to it such as a list of possible topics that the text can fall under, most-frequently occurring words in the text along with their weightages in/contribution to the overall text etc.

It makes use of a number of algorithms at different stages (cleaning, pre-processing, analysis, representation) such as:
#####• Vectorization (using CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, and Word2Vec)
#####• Topic Modelling (using LDA)
#####• Data Visualisation (using pyLDAvis, word clouds, and t-SNE charts)
